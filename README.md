# Hanabi Game

**This program was made using Dev-C++ and written in C language. Hanabi is a cooperative game, i.e. a game where the players do not play against each other but
work together towards a common goal. In this case they are absent minded firework
manufacturers who accidentally mixed up powders, fuses and rockets from a firework display.
The show is about to start and panic is setting in. They have to work together to stop the
show becoming a disaster! The pyrotechnicians have to put together 5 fireworks, 1 white, 1
red, 1 blue, 1 yellow, 1 green), by making series rising in number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) with the same
coloured cards.**
