work together towards a common goal.** In this case they are absent minded firework
manufacturers who accidentally mixed up powders, fuses and rockets from a firework display.
The show is about to start and panic is setting in. They have to work together to stop the
show becoming a disaster! The pyrotechnicians have to put together **5** fireworks, ***1 white, 1
red, 1 blue, 1 yellow, 1 green***, by making series rising in number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) with the same
coloured cards.
